# AngularAddAuthTokenNgrx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the following:
 
* [NGRX](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) project structure.
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/) based authentication with [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) back-end.
* Using [NGRX](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) store selectors in an HTTP request interceptor to automatically add the auth token to request headers.
* Using secure, protected [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) API endpoints that require a valid [JWT](https://jwt.io/).
* Protected Angular routes using [Route Guards](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards) that determine if the user is authenticated via [NGRX](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) selectors.
* Running the application locally in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) stack. 

## Getting Started

Letâ€™s clone the repo and fire up the app so we can see it in action:

```
wasi$ git clone https://github.com/webappsolution/angular-add-auth-token-ngrx.git
wasi$ git checkout feature/step-3-dockerize
```

You can run the app with or without Docker -- choose and use only one of the following run options:

### Run 1: Without Docker

**NOTE:** This assumes you've already checked out the project with the corresponding branch.

Open up 2 terminals (or 1 new one and use the one we used for Git checkout): 

**Terminal 1**

```
wasi$ cd client
wasi$ npm i
wasi$ npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2**

```
wasi$ cd server
wasi$ npm i
wasi$ npm run server-auth
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Run 2: With Docker

**NOTE:** This assumes you've already checked out the project with the corresponding branch.

**NOTE**: This assumes you have [Docker installed and running locally](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Open up a terminal and enter the following commands: 

```
wasi$ cd docker
wasi$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/` to run the app in the browser.

**NOTE**: If you know how to build docker images you can also edit and use the Docker stack YAML file to run the app locally: 
`docker stack deploy -c ./local.yml blog`

### Login or Register

You can login with the following credentials or click the "Register" button and create your own user that's persisted for the 
current session:
Without Docker
**User 1**

* username: `tom.brady@patriots.com`
* password: `goat`

**User 2**

* username: `test@test.com`
* password: `test`

**User 3**

* username: `admin@admin.com`
* password: `admin`

**NOTE**: Additional users can be added to `server/database/mock/users.json`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
